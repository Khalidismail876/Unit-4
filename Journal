Summary - the first computer appeared in 1950 to 1960 and it was only owned by big companies. These networks were called 
local area network or LAT and they often be as small as an entire room or as big as a university campus. Most famous of
of these LATs was called ethenets, they used to be used in 1970 and its still been used till today. The ethenet works with 
other ethenet computers and they are connected through ethenet cable that carries messages from one ethenet to another. To
avoid any confusion while sending messages, ethenet computers all have thier 'mac address' which creates a better communication.
These ethenets computers suffer what is called collision which is caused when multiple computers are sending messages. This
makes the computer confused and the ethenet cable can't submit a proper message. They avoid this by using random timer, this 
is not a good solution but it helps them communicate. They started to create another solution which is by assigning each 
computer to its own cable and this process is called collision domain. Anothe solution they rely on routing which trasmits 
a signal to its destination but this is expensive to a lot of user. Message switching is another way that messages are 
send, this makes the messages pass multiple hop counts. To finaly solve all these messages from colliding, they creates 
ipaddress which another term that they called packets and that is how each device got its ipaddress.
