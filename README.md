  # Definition of the problem
  Abokor wants to help most of the Somali teenagers who are struggling with their academics to get support. He wants a platform called AqoonMaal(knowledgeseeker)in   which he could upload videos that covers most of the Somali curriculums. But he faced a problem on what kind of platform that he needs and how could he make         people access it for free. On top of free access, he wants to have a platform that is organized neatly, and aesthetically appealing  to the users. 
  
  He wants a platform in which when you access it, one can easily see the available course and if they need any specific lessons, they could use the search mechanic   to find it. The platform need to have some sort of system in which allows the user to not lose track on their progress and all thier data to be saved. He wants to   show all the available course after a user gets access of the platform and for each course, the user need to see the sub catagories available in the course. For     example, if a user is interested in science, there must be a function in which he could see the sub course such as Biology, chemistry, and physics. There must be   a machanic in which allows the manager to upload and edit everything that would be visible to the users. 
  
  # Client Request 
  coming soon (The client need to make sure everything that he need is in his request)
  
  # Proposed Solution
  To help Abokor give Somali teenagers the helps they need to get better at their academics, we proposed to design a website called AqoonMaal. This website will be   free to access and all that the user needs is internet connection. After the user loads the page, a signup/registration page will be presented, this is to help     the user safe all their progress and if they leave or their website is some how closed, they can always come back, login and continue where they left at. When a     user signup or logsin, they will be taken to the main home page which shows the available courses. To know more about the available sub courses, the user can       hover over each course grid to see what is available but if they are using a phone then clicking on it take them to sub course page. A machanic will be created in   which allows abokor to upload and edit everything that the user will see in the website. This machanic will be only available for the manager in this case abokor,   and anyone he wants to share with. The website will be easy to use and it will be aesthetically appealing to the users as good animations are used. The website     will also have a search function, this will allow the user find any specific topic that they need without looking for it and saves them time. Finally, ABOUT page   will be added to help users know who is uploading these videos.
